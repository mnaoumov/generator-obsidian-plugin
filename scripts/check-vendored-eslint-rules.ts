 *
 * Gate for the ESLint rule sources this repo vendors out of `obsidian-dev-utils`.
 *
 * This repo resolves no dependency on `obsidian-dev-utils` - it is a sibling of it, not a consumer - so the
 * custom rules it lints itself with are hand-copied out of that repo's
 * `src/script-utils/linters/eslint-rules/` rather than imported. Nothing kept the copies honest, and they had
 * aged apart in three directions at once: refinements upstream made and no copy took, a local autofix
 * rewriting a copy in place, and a copy whose behavior had quietly diverged from the rule it is named after.
 * One tree had never been compared to anything at all.
 *
 * What this asserts is byte-identity after a recorded transform. The copies are supposed to be the same
 * bytes, so there is no "which side is stricter" judgement to make and no ESLint has to resolve anything -
 * which is what makes this check cheap where the same question about the shared ESLint **config** is not.
 *
 * Four things it does deliberately:
 *
 * 1. **A deliberate difference is recorded as the TRANSFORM that reproduces it**, in {@link TRANSFORM_ARMS},
 *    rather than as a comment no checker can parse. Each arm carries the reason it exists and the files it
 *    applies to, so accepting a divergence is a code change that every later run then enforces.
 * 2. **It enumerates the TREES, not the directories.** Any file anywhere in this repo named after an upstream
 *    rule source is a copy, wherever it sits - including inside a self-contained subpackage with its own
 *    `package.json`. Walking one known path per repo is how a second tree was never compared to anything.
 * 3. **This repo's side is READ FROM THE INDEX**, not from the working tree ({@link readIndexContent}). A
 *    local autofix rewriting a copy in place is one of the three drift directions above, and `lint:fix` and
 *    `format` do exactly that to a staged file in the same commit this runs in. nano-staged cannot be made
 *    to run this after them - it runs its per-pattern task groups with `Promise.all`, so a separate key
 *    RACES the fixer rather than following it (measured against 1.0.2, 2026-09-19; sequencing exists within
 *    one key's command list and nowhere else). Reading the index makes that ordering irrelevant instead of
 *    trying to enforce it, and answers the same question when a developer runs this by hand mid-edit. An
 *    untracked copy has no staged bytes and is read from disk.
 * 4. **The upstream list comes from upstream**, from the directory listing rather than from a roster restated
 *    here, so a rule added there is not invisible to this check. The sources are then read from
 *    `raw.githubusercontent.com`: the published npm package ships `dist/` only, so the `.ts` sources are not
 *    in it, and reading them off a sibling checkout would make this check pass only on a machine that happens
 *    to have one - which is the property that kept this check out of `obsidian-dev-utils` itself. The
 *    generated `index.ts` beside the sources would have been the cheaper listing and is not published: it is
 *    a build artifact and git ignores it, as it does the `.d.ts` files beside it.
 *
 * The copies in the sibling repos carry a per-script env toggle here, so a run with no network can opt out
 * explicitly rather than be skipped silently. This repo has no `helpers/env-toggle.ts` to hang one on, and
 * it is being retired, so the toggle is left out rather than ported in for it: run the script or do not.
